Brief is the new black, this is what inspires the team at Scissor. In today’s world, it’s important to keep things as short as possible, and this applies to more concepts than you may realize. From music, speeches, to wedding receptions, brief is the new black. Scissor is a simple tool which makes URLs as short as possible. Scissor thinks it can disrupt the URL shortening industry and give the likes of bit.ly and ow.ly a run for their money within 2 years.

## Requirements and Implementation

> - URL Shortening:
>   Scissor allows users to shorten URLs by pasting a long URL into the Scissor platform and a
>   shorter URL gets automatically generated. The shortened URL is designed to be as short as
>   possible, making it easy to share on social media or through other channels.
> - Custom URLs:
>   Scissor also allows users to customize their shortened URLs. Users can choose their own
>   custom domain name and customize the URL to reflect their brand or content. This feature is
>   particularly useful for individuals or small businesses who want to create branded links for their products.
> - QR Code Generation:
>   Scissor allows users to also generate QR codes for the shortened URLs. Users can download
>   the QR code image and use it in their promotional materials or/and on their website. This
>   feature will be implemented using a third-party QR code generator API, which can be integrated
>   into the Scissor platform.
> - Analytics:
>   Scissor provides basic analytics that allow users to track their shortened URL's performance.
>   Users can see how many clicks their shortened URL has received and where the clicks are
>   coming from. We need to track when a URL is used.
